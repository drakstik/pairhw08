Our design for the Interactive view involved creating a hybrid controller and view, and modifying our model slightly. The new view contains all of the buttons required to start, pause, play etc. the animation. The controller contains listener functions that are triggered when these button are pressed in the view. Out hybrid view extends the visual view from previous assignments. The reasoning for this was that the new view is essentially a visual view with added functionality, and the SVG functionality added is minimal. The hybrid controller contained within it an SVG controller and a visual controller. This decision was based on the fact that this controller needed to support all of the functionality of both controllers, in addition to new functionality, so composition was a reasonable choice. In the hybrid view, the window must be maximized before the user can interact and see the animation. The panel at the top of the window is essentially a status panel, which first provides the user with a description of all shapes and their associated types, asking if any can/should be removed. Then once the animation has begun, that panel displays up-to-date information about the animation itself. (When its paused, playing, what speed it’s playing at, if it’s looping, etc.) The changes in the model were limited to adding the ability to remove shapes by name, which was used by the controller to remove user-specified shapes before the animation begins.
